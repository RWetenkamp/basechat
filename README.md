rwbasechat is a simple chat webpart to include as webparts on SharePoint Online sites. It allows you to communicate through chat messages with your SharePoint audience.
To achieve this, this webpart uses a SharePoint list where the messages are stored. There is emoji support, but still a lot to do, especially on security and stability issues.
